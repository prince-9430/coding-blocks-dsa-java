/*What is the difference between int[] arr; and int arr[]; in Java?
(Is there any difference?) */


    /*Great question! In Java:

java
Copy
Edit
int[] arr;
and

java
Copy
Edit
int arr[];
🔹 Both are valid and mean the same thing — they declare an array of integers.

✅ Difference (only in style):
Syntax	Meaning	Common Use
int[] arr;	Preferred by Java convention	✅ Cleaner, consistent
int arr[];	Also valid (C/C++ style)	Used by C/C++ programmers

🔍 Why prefer int[] arr;?
It's clearer that the type is an array of int (int[]).

Helps avoid confusion when declaring multiple variables.

❌ For example:
java
Copy
Edit
int arr1[], arr2;  // Only arr1 is an array, arr2 is just an int!
✅ Better:
java
Copy
Edit
int[] arr1;
int arr2;
✅ Conclusion:
No functional difference, both work.

Use int[] arr; — it's cleaner and recommended in Java. ✅ */
